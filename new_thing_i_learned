the coolest and most useful thing ive earned and used is the binding
pry technique that adds the availability to look around inside
your code and see what is actually happening using this I was able to finish
the homework last weekend the problem in particular was one
where I was was sure i was moving objects around but thanks
to the binding pry i was able to find out i was using an array with
objects inside it so it made more clear what self was in this instance and
really made me understand some of the hardest parts for me in ruby
