On may 20 I want to be able to work for twitter or facebook no problem
I wrote a lot on my sheet but three things stick out
1. ask friends and family what my strengths and weaknesses are
2. sound out emails too oculus and nervana
3. gor to meetups or wor fpr free
fun things to learn would be basic ios or android
