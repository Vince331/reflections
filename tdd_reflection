reflection: "Dear Monday me, lets talk about TDD"
Explain how to do TDD to Monday you,
who didn't know anything about it.

Hi monday me
well you knew a little TDD from the test_first_ruby
homework you did with app academy but now you learned
how to make tests and how to come up with tests from scratch.
Just to recap TDD or Test driven development is how you test your code
to make sure errors are corrected before they reach anywhere near the end of the line
in temrs of production. the first thought might be that testing will take more time but
down the line if a bug is found that costs everyone way more
in terms of time and money so testing first is always the right answer
the framework we use in this class is mrspec
